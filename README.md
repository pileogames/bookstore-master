# Bookstore

The bookstore example implements a typical list based application with native navigation. A CollectionView displays book entries with images and text and enables filtering of book lists.
(Jason, Justin, Taylor)

We have tweaked this bookstore example by changing it from a book store catalog app to a jdm car catalog
for enthusiasts. Each car has a comment on it and a list of alternative jdm cars that are related.
As of now there are only 5 cars but that list will grow quickly in further development.
